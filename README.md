# Surfs_Up

## The SurfsUp analysis aims to provide an indepth look at temperatures on the island of Oahu during December and June. 
By analyzing the data during seasonally extreme months, the client is able to make an informed decision around the viability of opening and operating a surf and ice cream shop year-round. 

### Results: 
* Analysis of 'June Temps' supports opening a surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu. Over 1,700 temperatures were recorded between 9 different weather stations around the island. With the lowest temp being 65 degrees fahrenheit and the highest being 85 degrees fahrenheit, a surf and ice cream shop should stay busy.
* Analysis of 'Dec Temps' reinforces the idea of operating a surf and ice cream shop year round. While a low of 56 degrees fahrenheit is cooler than the low of 65 degrees in June, December also saw a high temp of 83 degrees, only 2 degrees cooler than June's high.
*  June and December temps are relatively similar and indicate minimal temperature changes throughout the year, a great sign for the surf and ice cream shop. This is best illustrated in the images below. Comparison of the 75th, 50th, and 25th percentiles really reiterate how similar these months are.

### Summary: 
This analysis utilized over 2,200 different temperature data points to provide insight into the termperature changes on the island of Oahu, ensuring the client has ample temperature data for review. Prior to making a final decision, I would recommend the client determine how many days in June and December had precipitation, to better understand the viability of a combo surf and ice cream shop year-round. Ice cream is great rain or shine, surfing, maybe not. If the client was able to provide additonal temperature and precipitation parameters, I would recommend a query to determine how many days a year Oahu experiences client acceptable weather.
